Abstract:
Given a dataset with the percentage of people who consume a certain type of food in European countries

Intro:
Upon analyzing the dataset, a small amount of NAs were found. Particularly, Spain was missing a "Sweetener" statistic, Sweden was missing a "Biscuits" statistic, and Finland was missing a "Yoghurt" statistic. Because there is no other data to help make an estimate of these values, it was decided that these countries should simply be omitted. A study of the remaining 13 countries across 21 dimensions is appropriate and extensive enough to provide some interesting analysis.

```{r}
faces2(ds[,-1], labels=c)
```

  From the Chernoff Faces, we can see countries who are similar accross the first 18 out of 20 food consumptions, which excludes yoghurt and crisp bread.
  Italy, Belgium, and France all have football, oval shaped heads. This shows how these three countries have a small population of people that drink tea. Upon further examintion of figure ___, this is indeed true, as those three countries have the lowest percenage of people who drink tea. Similarly, Luxembourg, Holland, Ireland, and Switzerland all have long noses, indicating they have the highest percentage of people who drink powdered soup. 
  Using the chernoff faces as a brief initial analysis to identify trends between countries, star plots of the interesting variables are plotted in figure ___.
  

To further see similarities across all 20 dimensions, a star plot was taken to include yoghurt and crisp bread consumption.

```{r}
stars(ds[,2:20],
      nrow=4,ncol=4,labels=c, main="Star Plot of Food Consumption")
```


Trees of all 20 dimensions across 13 countries
```{r}
mtree <- hclust(dist(ds), method="average")
plot(mtree,labels=c,ylab="Distance",main="Average linkage") 
mtree2 <- hclust(dist(ds), method="single")
plot(mtree2,labels=c,ylab="Distance",main="Single linkage") 
mtree3 <- hclust(dist(ds), method="complete")
plot(mtree3,labels=c,ylab="Distance",main="Complete linkage") 

```


```{r}
y <- cbind(real.coffee, instant.coffee, tea, sweetener, biscuits, powder.soup, tin.soup, potatoes, frozen.fish, frozen.veggies, apples, oranges, tinned.fruit, jam, garlic, butter, margarine, olive.oil, yogurt, crisp.bread)

cor(y)

pca <- prcomp(y, scale=T)
#summary(pca)

a1 <- pca$rotation[,1];a1
center <- pca$center
scale <- pca$scale
temp <- as.matrix(ds[,-1])
drop(scale(temp, center = center, scale = scale) %*% pca$rotation[,1])
#predict(pca)[,1]

plot(pca)
```

With PC1, PC2, PC3, and PC4, approximately 74% of the total variance is accounted for.


Within the 20 dimensions, there are a couple variables that are interesting to further analyze within their own group. This includes the following subgroups:

Group 1: Real Coffee, Instant Coffee, Tea, Sweetener, Biscuits
Group 2: Butter, Margarine, Olive Oil
Group 3: Apples, Oranges, Tinned Fruit, Jam
Group 4: Frozen Fish, Frozen Vegetables
Group 5: Tin Soup, Powder Soup

```{r}
pairs(ds[,17:19],
  panel=function(x,y,...){
    points(x,y,...)
    #text(y ~ x, labels = short.c)
    abline(lm(y ~ x),col="red")
  },col="blue")
```

```{r}
pairs(ds[,12:15],
  panel=function(x,y,...){
    points(x,y,...)
    #text(y ~ x, labels = short.c)
    abline(lm(y ~ x),col="red")
  },col="blue")
```
At a glance, apples and oranges 
```{r}
pairs(ds[,2:6],
  panel=function(x,y,...){
    points(x,y,...)
    #text(y ~ x, labels = short.c)
    abline(lm(y ~ x),col="red")
  },col="blue")
```
Here we can see how the sweetener is positively correlated with real coffee, instant coffee, and tea. This suggests countries with a high number of coffee, instant coffee, and tea drinkers, are also likely to have a high number of sweetener users. It's also apparent that people seem to enjoy eating biscuits with all three drinks. In the biscuits vs real coffee, the line of best fit looks like a negative correlation. When observing a scatterplot, it's clear to see that there are outliers Ireland and England, due to the fact that both these countries are heavy tea drinkers and barely have a coffee drinking population. Upon removing these outliers, a positive correlation between Biscuits and Real Coffee is revealed.

```{r}
plot(biscuits ~ real.coffee, type = "n")
text(biscuits ~ real.coffee, labels = c)

plot(tea ~ real.coffee, type = "n")
text(tea ~ real.coffee, labels = c)

```

Looking at a world map, England and Ireland are geographically connected and located right next to each other. Some cultural similarities most likely carried over between the two countries, thus resulting in both these countries having dense population of tea drinkers. With this in mind, it is worth investigating whether where countries are geographically located influences their different food consumption population. This leads to some multidimensional scaling (MDS).

```{r}
dm <- dist(ds[,-1])
mds <- cmdscale(dm,k=11,eig=TRUE)
mds$eig
sum(abs(mds$eig[1:2]))/sum(abs(mds$eig))
sum(mds$eig[1:2]^2)/sum(mds$eig^2)
par(cex=1.5)
plot(-mds$points[,1],-mds$points[,2],type="n", xlab="Coordinate 1",ylab="Coordinate 2", main="Classic MDS")
text(-mds$points[,1],-mds$points[,2], labels = c, col="red")
```




```{r}
y <- cbind(real.coffee, instant.coffee, tea, sweetener, biscuits)

cor(y)

pca <- prcomp(y, scale=T)
summary(pca)

a1 <- pca$rotation[,1];a1
center <- pca$center
scale <- pca$scale
temp <- as.matrix(ds[,c(2:6)])
drop(scale(temp, center = center, scale = scale) %*% pca$rotation[,1])
#predict(pca)[,1]

plot(pca)
```


```{r}

plot(ds$Real.coffee ~ ds$Tea, xlab = "Tea", ylab = "Coffee", main = "Coffee vs Tea", type="n")
text(ds$Real.coffee ~ds$Tea, labels = c)

plot(ds$Real.coffee ~ ds$Instant.coffee, type="n")
text(ds$Real.coffee ~ds$Tea, labels = c, ylab = "Coffee", xlab = "Instant Coffee", main = "Coffee vs Instant Coffee")

plot(ds$Real.coffee ~ ds$Biscuits, type="n")
text(ds$Real.coffee ~ds$Biscuits, labels = c, ylab = "Coffee", xlab = "Biscuits", main = "Coffee vs Biscuits")


plot(ds$Margarine ~ ds$Butter, type="n", main = "Butter vs Margarine")
text(ds$Margarine ~ds$Butter, labels = c)

plot(ds$Margarine ~ ds$Butter, type="n", main = "Butter vs Margarine")
text(ds$Margarine ~ds$Butter, labels = c)

plot(ds$Potatoes, type="n")
text(ds$Potatoes, labels = c)

plot(biscuits ~ real.coffee, type = "n")
text(biscuits ~ real.coffee, labels = c)

plot(biscuits ~ tea, type = "n")
